<em>This section is
    non-normative.</em>
    <p>This guide provides some examples and resources for

    available in the core specification.</p>
    <p>It may be useful to first familiarize yourself with the

    <p>The <a href="www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">data

    <p>When expressing statements about a specific entity, such as
    a person, product, or organization, it is often useful to have
    an identifier for it so that others can express statements
    about the same thing. The <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable
    credentials</a> <a href="www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model//">data model
    specification</a> contains numerous examples where the
    identifier is a <a href="w3c-ccg.github.io/did-primer/">decentralized
    identifier</a>, also known as a DID. An example of a DID is
    <code>did:example:123456abcdef</code>.</p>
    <p>There is currently a proposed charter for a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <a href="w3c-ccg.github.io/did-wg-charter/">Decentralized
    Identifier Working Group</a>, which will put DIDs on track to
    become a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>

      Specifically, <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credentials</a>

      is expected that many <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable

</h3>
      <p>Protecting the integrity of content is an important
      component of verification. <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Verifiers</a> need to have
      confidence that the content they rely on to verify <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credentials</a> doesn't change without their knowledge.
      This content may include data schemas, identifiers, public
      keys, etc.</p>
      <p>There are a number of ways to provide content integrity
      protection. A few of these are described in greater detail
      below.</p>

        One example of a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-data-registries" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable data
        registry</a> which provides content integrity protection is
        a distributed ledger. This is a shared transaction record
        which provides mechanisms for verifying the content it
        stores. These mechanisms include consensus protocols,
        digital signatures, and verifiable data structures such as
        Merkle trees. These mechanisms provide cryptographic
        assurances that the content retrieved from the ledger has
        not been altered, and is complete.</p>

    <p>Usage of <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credentials</a>

</h3>
      <p>The simplest way for a <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> to
      reference another external credential is to link to it,
      either directly by using its URI, or indirectly by providing
      a well-known ID (for example, a credential modeling an
      internal company Invoice may refer to its parent Purchase
      Order credential simply by the PO Number, relevant only
      within the context of this specific enterprise).</p>
      <p>This method of linking to an external credential without
      using an integrity protection mechanism may be acceptable in
      some use cases, such as when both credentials are issued by
      the same entity, the verifier has a high level of trust and
      confidence in the issuer's security and auditing mechanisms,
      and the risk to the verifier is sufficiently low. However,
      implementers should keep in mind that although the credential
      that contains the reference may be integrity protected itself
      (by a cryptographic signature or a similar proof mechanism),
      the verifier has no way of knowing that the external
      credential being linked to has not been tampered with, unless
      the link itself has a content integrity protection mechanism
      built into it.</p>

      is to use a linking mechanism that cryptographically binds

      way to accomplish this would be to use <a href="#dfn-hashlinks" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">hashlinks</a> or an equivalent URI scheme. Another
      mechanism would be to encode the full contents of the target
      credential in the URI itself, although this is much less
      commonly used, and the discussion of the practical limits of
      URI length are outside the scope of this document.</p>

</h2>
    <p>There are at least two different cases to consider where an
    <a href="#dfn-entities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entity</a> wants to dispute a <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> issued
    by an <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <a href="#dfn-subjects" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">subject</a> disputes a claim made by the
      <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a>. For example, the <code>address</code>
      property is incorrect or out of date.
      </li>
      <li>An <a href="#dfn-entities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entity</a> disputes a potentially false
      claim made by the <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a> about a different <a href="#dfn-subjects" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">subject</a>. For example, an imposter has claimed the
        social security number for an <a href="#dfn-entities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entity</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The mechanism for issuing a <code>DisputeCredential</code>
    is the same as for a regular <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a>, except that
    the <code>credentialSubject</code> identifier in the
    <code>DisputeCredential</code> property is the identifier of
    the disputed <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a>.</p>
    <p>For example, if a <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> with an
    identifier of <code>https://example.org/credentials/245</code>
    is disputed, an <a href="#dfn-entities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entity</a> can issue one of the <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credentials</a> shown below. In the first example, the
    <a href="#dfn-subjects" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">subject</a> might present this to the <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a> along with the disputed <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a>. In the second example, the <a href="#dfn-entities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entity</a> might publish the
    <code>DisputeCredential</code> in a public venue to make it
    known that the <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> is disputed.</p>

    <p>The JWT <code>aud</code> <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> name refers to

    <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier(s)</a>). Consequently this is an alternative to
    the Linked Data Proof method specified above. It lets the
    <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> indicate which <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier(s)</a> it allows to

    Any JWT-compliant <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a> that is not identified in the

    <p><a href="tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">RFC 7519</a>

</h2>
<em>This section is non-normative.</em>
    <p>The Verifiable Credentials Data Model is designed around an
    <em>open world assumption</em>, meaning that any entity can say
    anything about another entity. This approach enables
    permissionless innovation; there is no centralized registry or
    authority through which an extension author must register
    themselves nor the specific data models and vocabularies they
    create.</p>
    <p>Instead, credential data model authors are expected to use
    machine-readable vocabularies through the use of [LINKED-DATA].
    This implementation guide provides examples for how to express
    data models using a data format that is popular with software
    developers and web page authors called [JSON-LD]. This data
    format provides features that enable authors to express their
    data models in idiomatic JSON while also ensuring that their
    vocabulary terms are unambigiously understood, even by software
    that does not implement JSON-LD processing.</p>
    <p>The Verifiable Credentials data model also uses a
    graph-based data model, which allows authors to model both
    simple relationships that describe one or more attributes for a
    single entity and complex multi-entity relationships.</p>
    <p>The rest of this section describes how to author extensions
    that build on the Verifiable Credentials Data Model.</p>

</h3>
      <p>We expect the most common extensions to the Verifiable
      Credentials Data Model to be new credential types. Whenever
      someone has something to say about one or more entities and
      they want their authorship to be verifiable, they should use
      a Verifiable Credential. Sometimes there may be an existing
      credential type, that someone else has created, that can be
      reused to make the statements they want to make. However,
      there are often cases where new credential types are
      needed.</p>
      <p>New credential types can be created by following a few
      steps. This guide will also walk you through creating an
      example new credential type. At a high level, the steps to
      follow are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Design the data model.</li>
        <li>Create a new JSON-LD context.</li>
        <li>Select a publishing location.</li>
        <li>Use the new JSON-LD context when issuing new
        credentials.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So, let's walk through creating a new credential type
      which we will call <code>ExampleAddressCredential</code>. The
      purpose of this credential will be to express a person's
      postal address.</p>
      <h4 id="design-the-data-model">Design the data model<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#creating-new-credential-types"></a>
</h4>
      <p>First, we must design a data model for our new credential
      type. We know that we will need to be able to express the
      basics of a postal address, things like a person's city,
      state, and zipcode. Of course, those items are quite US
      centric, so we should consider internationalizing those
      terms. But before we go further, since we're using
      [LINKED-DATA] vocabularies, there is a good chance that
      commonly known concepts may already have a vocabulary that
      someone else has created that we can leverage.</p>
      <p>If we are going to use someone else's vocabulary, we will
      want to make sure it is stable and unlikely to change in any
      significant way. There may even be technologies that we can
      make use of that store immutable vocabularies that we can
      reference, but those are not the focus of this example. Here
      we will rely on the inertia that comes from a very popularly
      used vocabulary on the Web, schema.org. It turns out that
      this vocabulary has just what we need; it has already modeled
      a postal address and even has examples for how to express it
      using JSON-LD.</p>
      <p>Please note that schema.org is developed incrementally,
      meaning that the definition of a term today may differ from a
      future definition, or even be removed. Although schema.org
      developers encourage using the latest release, as in the
      simple non-versioned schema.org URLs such as
      <code>http://schema.org/Place</code> in structured data
      applications, there are times in which more precise
      versioning is important. Schema.org also provides dated
      snapshots of each release, including both human and machine
      readable definitions of the schema.org core vocabulary. These
      are linked from the <a href="schema.org/docs/releases.html">releases page</a>.
      For instance, instead of the unversioned URI
      <code>http://schema.org/Place</code>, you might use the
      versioned URI
      <code>https://schema.org/version/3.9/schema-all.html#term_Place</code>.
      In addition, the <code>schemaVersion</code> property has been
      defined to provide a way for documents to indicate the
      specific intended version of schema.org's definitions.</p>
      <p>Using the schema.org vocabulary and JSON-LD we can express
      a person's address like so:</p>
      <div class="example" id="example-6-example-schema-org-address">
        <div class="marker">
          <a class="self-link" href="#example-6-example-schema-org-address">Example
          <bdi>6</bdi></a><span class="example-title">: Example
          schema.org address</span>
        </div>
        <pre class="nohighlight">{
  <span class="highlight">
  "@context": [
    "http://schema.org"
  ]</span>,
  "type": "Person",
  "address": {
    "type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Main St."
    "addressLocality": "Blacksburg",
    "addressRegion": "VA",
    "postalCode": "24060",
    "addressCountry": "US"
  }
}</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Note the above <code>@context</code> key in the JSON. This
      <code>@context</code> refers to a machine-readable file (also
      expressed in JSON) that provides term definitions [JSON-LD].
      A term definition maps a key or type used in the JSON, such
      as <code>address</code> or <code>PostalAddress</code>, to a
      globally unique identifier: a URL.</p>
      <p>This ensures that when software sees the
      <code>@context</code> <em>http://schema.org</em>, that it
      will interpret the the keys and types in the JSON in a
      globally consistent way, without requiring developers to use
      full URLs in the JSON or in the code that may traverse it. As
      long as the software is aware of the specific
      <code>@context</code> used (or if it uses JSON-LD processing
      to transform it to some other known <code>@context</code>),
      then it will understand the <em>context</em> in which the
      JSON was written and meant to be understood. The use of
      <code>@context</code> also allows [JSON-LD] keywords such as
      <code>@type</code> to be aliased to the simpler
      <code>type</code> as is done in the above example.</p>
      <p>Note that we could also express the JSON using full URLs,
      if we want to avoid using <em>@context</em>. Here is what the
      example would look like if we did that:</p>
      <div class="example" id="example-7-example-schema-org-address-with-full-urls">
        <div class="marker">
          <a class="self-link" href="#example-7-example-schema-org-address-with-full-urls">Example
          <bdi>7</bdi></a><span class="example-title">: Example
          schema.org address with full URLs</span>
        </div>
        <pre class="nohighlight">{
  "@type": "http://schema.org/Person",
  "http://schema.org/address": {
    "@type": "http://schema.org/PostalAddress",
    "http://schema.org/streetAddress": "123 Main St."
    "http://schema.org/addressLocality": "Blacksburg",
    "http://schema.org/addressRegion": "VA",
    "http://schema.org/postalCode": "24060",
    "http://schema.org/addressCountry": "US"
  }
}</pre>
      </div>
      <p>While this form is an acceptable way to express the
      information such that it is unambiguous, many software
      developers would prefer to use more idiomatic JSON. The use
      of <code>@context</code> enables idiomatic JSON without
      losing global consistency and without the need for a
      centralized registry or authority for creating extensions.
      Note that <code>@context</code> can also have more than one
      value. In this case, a JSON array is used to express multiple
      values, where each value references another context that
      defines terms. Using this mechanism we can first bring in the
      terms defined in the Verifiable Credentials Data Model
      specification and then bring in the terms defined by
      schema.org:</p>
      <div class="example" id="example-8-example-address-credential-with-schema-org-context">
        <div class="marker">
          <a class="self-link" href="#example-8-example-address-credential-with-schema-org-context">
          Example <bdi>8</bdi></a><span class="example-title">:
          Example address credential with schema.org context</span>
        </div>
        <pre class="nohighlight">{
  <span class="highlight">
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "http://schema.org"
  ]</span>,
  <span class="comment">...</span>
  "credentialSubject": {
    "type": "Person",

      "type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "123 Main St."
      "addressLocality": "Blacksburg",

      "postalCode": "24060",
      "addressCountry": "US"
    }
  },
  <span class="comment">...</span>
}</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Note, however, that each <em>context</em> might have a
      different definition for the same term, e.g., the JSON key
      <code>address</code> might map to a different URL in each
      <em>context</em>. By default, [JSON-LD] allows terms in a
      <code>@context</code> to be redefined using a <em>last term
      wins</em> order. While these changes can be safely dealt with
      by using JSON-LD processing, we want to lower the burden on
      consumers of Verifiable Credentials. We want consumer
      software to be able to make assumptions about the meaning of
      terms by only having to read and understand the string value
      associated with the <code>@context</code> key. We don't want
      them to have to worry about terms being redefined in
      unexpected ways. That way their software can inspect only the
      <code>@context</code> values and then be hard coded to
      understand the meaning of the terms.</p>
      <p>In order to prevent term redefinition, the [JSON-LD]
      <code>@protected</code> feature must be applied to term
      definitions in the <code>@context</code>. All terms in the
      core Verifiable Credentials <code>@context</code> are already
      protected in this way. The only time that an existing term is
      allowed to be redefined is if the new definition is scoped
      underneath another new term that is defined in a
      <em>context</em>. This matches developer expectations and
      ensures that consumer software has strong guarantees about
      the semantics of the data it is processing; it can be written
      such that it is never confused about the definition of a
      term. Note that consumers must determine their own risk
      profile for how to handle any credentials their software
      processes that include terms that it does not understand.</p>
      <h4 id="create-a-new-json-ld-context">Create a new JSON-LD
      context<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#creating-new-credential-types"></a>
</h4>
      <p>Given the above, there is at least one reason why we don't
      want to use the schema.org <em>context</em>: it is designed
      to be very flexible and thus does not use the
      <code>@protected</code> feature. There are a few additional
      reasons we want to create our own [JSON-LD] context though.
      First, the schema.org context does not define our new
      credential type: <em>ExampleAddressCredential</em>. Second,
      it is not served via a secure protocol (e.g.,
      <em>https</em>); rather, it uses <em>http</em>. Note that
      this is less of a concern than it may seem, as it is
      recommended that all Verifiable Credential consumer software
      hard code the <code>@context</code> values it understands and
      not reach out to the Web to fetch them. Lastly, it is a very
      large context, containing many more term definitions than are
      necessary for our purposes.</p>
      <p>So, we will create our own [JSON-LD] context that
      expresses just those term definitions that we need for our
      new credential type. Note that this does not mean that we
      must mint new URLs; we can still reuse the schema.org
      vocabulary terms. All we are doing is creating a more concise
      and targeted context. Here's what we'll need in our
      context:</p>
      <div class="example" id="example-9-example-address-credential-context">
        <div class="marker">
          <a class="self-link" href="#example-9-example-address-credential-context">Example
          <bdi>9</bdi></a><span class="example-title">: Example
          address credential context</span>
        </div>
        <pre class="nohighlight">{
  "@version": 1.1,
  "@protected": true,

  "ExampleAddressCredential":
    "https://example.org/ExampleAddressCredential",

  "Person": {
    "@id": "http://schema.org/Person",
    "@context": {
      "@version": 1.1,
      "@protected": true,

      "address": "http://schema.org/address"
    }
  },
  "PostalAddress": {
    "@id": "http://schema.org/PostalAddress",
    "@context": {
      "@version": 1.1,
      "@protected": true,

      "streetAddress": "http://schema.org/streetAddress",
      "addressLocality": "http://schema.org/addressLocality",
      "addressRegion": "http://schema.org/addressRegion",
      "postalCode": "http://schema.org/postalCode",
      "addressCountry": "http://schema.org/addressCountry"
    }
  }
}</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The above context defines a term for our new credential
      type <em>ExampleAddressCredential</em>, mapping it to the URL
      <em>https://example.org/ExampleAddressCredential</em>. We
      could have also chosen a URI like
      <em>urn:private-example:ExampleAddressCredential</em>, but
      this approach would not allow us to serve up a Web page to
      describe it, if we so desire. The context also defines the
      terms for types <em>Person</em> and <em>PostalAddress</em>,
      mapping them to their schema.org vocabulary URLs.
      Furthermore, when those types are used, it also defines
      protected terms for each of them via a <em>scoped
      context</em>, mapping terms like <em>address</em> and
      <em>streetAddress</em> to their schema.org vocabulary URLs.
      For more information on how to write a JSON-LD context or
      <em>scoped contexts</em>, see the [JSON-LD]
      specification.</p>
      <h4 id="select-a-publishing-location">Select a publishing
      location<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#creating-new-credential-types"></a>
</h4>
      <p>Now that we have a [JSON-LD] context, we must give it a
      URL. Technically speaking, we could just use a URI, for
      example, a private URN such as
      <em>urn:private-example:my-extension</em>. However, if we
      want people to be able to read and discover it on the Web, we
      should give it a URL like
      <em>https://example.org/example-address-credential-context/v1</em>.</p>
      <p>When this URL is dereferenced, it should return
      <em>application/ld+json</em> by default, to allow JSON-LD
      processors to process the context. However, if a user agent
      requests <em>HTML</em>, it should return human readable text
      that explains, to humans, what the term definitions are and
      what they map to. Since we're reusing an existing vocabulary,
      schema.org, we can also simply link to the definitions of the
      meaning of our types and terms via their website. If we had
      created our own new vocabulary terms, we would describe them
      on our own site, ideally including machine readable
      Information as well.</p>

      Extending JWTs<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#extending-jwts"></a>
</h3>
      <p>The <cite><a href="www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials
      Data Model 1.0</a></cite> specifies a minimal set of JWT
      <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> names that are to be used to represent the
      properties of a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a>
      and its <code>credentialSubject</code>. Implementers may wish
      to extend a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a>
      with some properties that are new (e.g.,
      <code>drivingLicenseNumber</code>,
      <code>mySpecialProperty</code> or that are already registered
      with IANA as JWT <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> names (e.g.,
      <code>given_name</code>.
      <code>phone_number_verified</code>.</p>
      <p>As the <cite><a href="www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials
      Data Model 1.0</a></cite> states, such extension properties
      are best placed directly in either the JWT <code>vc</code>
      <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> or the <code>credentialSubject</code>
      property of the <code>vc</code> <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> as appropriate,
      although they <em><em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em></em> be placed directly into their own JWT
      <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claims</a>.</p>
      <p>If implementers wish to use JWT <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> names for
      these extensions, the following steps are recommended. Note
      that there are three types of JWT <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> name:
      public, named with a URI; private, named with a local name;
      and registered with IANA.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, check with IANA
        (https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml) to see if
        the JWT <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> name already exists.
        </li>
        <li>If it does not exist, the implementer may wish to
        either give it a public name (i.e., a URI), give it a local
        name (i.e., any string), or register it with IANA.</li>
        <li>Once the JWT <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> name exists, define
          encoding/decoding transformation rules to convert the
          <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a> property
          or <code>credentialSubject</code> property into the JWT
          <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Encoding</em>: Remove the property from the
              <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable
              credential</a>, encode it according to the defined
              rule, and place it in the JWT <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Decoding</em>: Remove the value from the JWT
              <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a>, decode it according

      <p>Extension authors are urged to publish two types of

      information is for machines, and is the machine-readable
      JSON-LD Context. The second type of information is for
      humans, and should be an HTML document. It is suggested that
      the default mode of operation is to serve the
      machine-readable JSON-LD Context as that is the primary
      intended use of the URL. If content-negotiation is supported,
      requests for <code>text/html</code> should result in a human
      readable document. The human readable document should at
      least contain usage information for the extension, such as
      the expected order of URLs associated with the
      <code>@context</code> property, specifications that elaborate
      on the extension, and examples of typical usage of the
      extension.</p>

    is designed to be proof format agnostic. <a href="w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">The specification</a>
    does not normatively require any particular digital proof or
    signature format. While the data model is the canonical
    representation of a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable
    credential</a> or <a href="#dfn-verifiable-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable
    presentation</a>, the proving mechanisms for these are often
    tied to the syntax used in the transmission of the document
    between parties. As such, each proofing mechanism has to
    specify whether the validation of the proof is calculated
    against the state of the document as transmitted, against the
    transformed data model, or against another form. At the time of
    publication, at least two proof formats are being actively
    utilized by implementers, and the Working Group felt that
    documenting what these proof formats are and how they are being
    used would be beneficial to other implementers.</p>
    <p>This guide provides tables in section <a href="#pf1b">Benefits of JWTs</a> and section <a href="#pf1b">Benefits of JSON-LD and LD-Proofs</a> that compare
    three syntax and proof format ecosystems; JSON+JWTs,
    JSON-LD+JWTs, and JSON-LD+LD-Proofs.</p>
    <p>Because the Verifiable Credentials Data Model is extensible,
    and agnostic to any particular proof format, the specification
    and use of additional proof formats is supported.</p>

        <dt id="pf3a">PF3a: Based on existing official
        standards.</dt>
        <dd>JSON and JWT are proposed and mature IETF standards.
        While JSON-LD 1.0 is in REC state in <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, JSON-LD 1.1 is
        still in WD state. LD-Proofs are not standardized at
        all.</dd>
        <dt id="pf4a">PF4a: Designed to be small in size.</dt>
        <dd>JSON was invented as a simple data format to be
        transmitted on the wire. A verifiable credential can be
        expressed by its attributes only, without the necessity to
        introduce additional meta-information such as @context.
        This makes the resulting JSON+JWT credential typically also
        smaller in size.</dd>
        <dt id="pf5a">PF5a: Offline support without further
        processing.</dt>
        <dd>A JWT can fully describe itself without the need to
        retrieve or verify any external documents. JSON-LD requires
        the context to be queryable and requires further documents
        to be accessible to check the prevalent document, e.g.,
        LD-Proof. Additional caching needs to be implemented to
        support offline use cases.</dd>
        <dt id="pf6a">PF6a: Wide adoption in other existing
        standards.</dt>
        <dd>JWT founds its application in many other existing
        standards, e.g., OAuth2, OpenID Connect. This allows for
        backward compatibility with existing authentication and
        authorization frameworks without or with only minor
        modifications to these legacy systems.</dd>
        <dt id="pf7a">PF7a: No type ambiguity.</dt>
        <dd>It is best practice that JSON data structures typically
        do not expect changing types of their internal attributes.
        JSON-LD has implicit support for compact form serialization
        which transforms arrays with a single element only to
        switch its data type. Developers writing parsers have to
        implement special handling of these data types, which
        results in more code, is more error-prone and sometimes
        does not allow parsers based on code generation, which rely
        on static types.</dd>
        <dt id="pf8a">PF8a: Broad library support.</dt>
        <dd>JWT and JSON due to its maturity and standardization,
        have a lot of open-source library support. While JSON-LD
        1.0 is a standard and has support for different programming
        languages, it is still behind JSON which is often part of
        the native platform toolchain, e.g., JavaScript. For
        LD-Proofs, on the other hand, only a few scattered
        libraries exist.</dd>
        <dt id="pf9a">PF9a: Easy to understand what is signed.</dt>
        <dd>JWT makes it visible what is signed in contrast to
        LD-Proofs, e.g., LD Signatures, that are detached from the
        actual payload and contain links to external documents
        which makes it not obvious for a developer to figure out
        what is part of the signature.</dd>
        <dt id="pf10a">PF10a: Ability to be used as authn/authz
        token with existing systems.</dt>
        <dd>Many existing applications rely on JWT for
        authentication and authorization purposes. In theory,
        developers maintaining these applications could leverage
        JWT-based verifiable presentations in their current systems
        with minor or no modifications. LD-Proofs represents a new
        approach which would require more work to achieve the same
        result.</dd>
        <dt id="pf11a">PF11a: No additional canonicalization
        required.</dt>
        <dd>Beyond base64 URL encoding JSON and JWT don't require
        any canonicalization to be transmitted on the wire. The JWS
        can be calculated on any data inside of the payload. This
        results in less computation, less complexity, and
        light-weight libraries compared to JSON-LD and LD-Proofs
        where canonicalization is required.</dd>
        <dt id="pf12a">PF12a: No Internet PKI required.</dt>
        <dd>JSON-LD and LD-Proofs rely on resolving external
        documents, e.g., <code>@context</code>. This means that a
        verifiable credential system would rely on existing
        Internet PKI to a certain extend and cannot be fully
        decentralized. A JWT-based system does not need to
        introduce this dependency.</dd>
        <dt id="pf13a">PF13a: No resolution of external documents
        needed.</dt>
        <dd>JSON-LD and LD-Proofs require the resolution of
        external documents, which leads to an increased network
        load for the verifier of a verifiable presentation. This
        needs to be mitigated through caching strategies.</dd>

        <dt id="pf1b">PF1b: Support for open world data
        modelling</dt>
        <dd>An <em>open world data model</em> is one where any
        entity can make any statement about anything while
        simultaneously ensuring that the semantics of the statement
        are unambiguous. This specification is enabled by an open
        world data model called Linked Data. One defining
        characteristic of supporting an open world data model is
        the ability to specify the semantic context in which data
        is being expressed. JSON-LD provides this mechanism via the
        <code>@context</code> property. JSON has no such
        feature.</dd>
        <dt id="pf2b">PF2b: Universal identifier mechanism for JSON
        objects via the use of URIs.</dt>
        <dd>All entities in a JSON-LD document are identified
        either via an automatic URI, or via an explicit URI. This
        enables all entities in a document to be unambiguously
        referenced. JSON does not have a native URI type nor does
        it require objects to have one, making it difficult to
        impossible to unambiguously identify an entity expressed in
        JSON.</dd>
        <dt id="pf3b">PF3b: A way to disambiguate properties shared
        among different JSON documents by mapping them to IRIs via
        a context.</dt>
        <dd>All object properties in a JSON-LD document, such as
        the property "homepage", are either keywords or they are
        mapped to an IRI. This feature enables open world systems
        to identify the semantic meaning of the property in an
        unambiguous way, which enables seamless merging of data
        between disparate systems. JSON object properties are not
        mapped to IRIs, which result in ambiguities with respect to
        the semantic meaning of the property. For example, one JSON
        document might use "title" (meaning "book title") in a way
        that is semantically incompatible with another JSON
        document using "title" (meaning "job title").</dd>
        <dt id="pf4b">PF4b: A mechanism to refer to data in an
        external document, where the data may be merged with the
        local document without a merge conflict in semantics or
        structure.</dt>
        <dd>JSON-LD provides a mechanism that enables a data value
        to use a URL to refer to data outside of the local
        document. This external data may then be automatically
        merged with the local document without a merge conflict in
        semantics or structure. This feature enables a system to
        apply the "follow your nose" principle to discover a richer
        set of data that is associated with the local document.
        While a JSON document can contain pointers to external
        data, interpreting the pointer is often application
        specific and usually does not support merging the external
        data to construct a richer data set.</dd>

        string is expressed via the use of language tags. JSON does
        not provide such a feature.</dd>

        a property value, such as Date, unsigned integer, or

        of information as a directed graph of labeled nodes and
        edges, which enables an open world data model to be
        supported. JSON's abstract data model only supports the
        expression of information as a tree of unlabeled nodes and
        edges, which restricts the types of relationships and
        structures that can be natively expressed in the

        <dt id="pf8b">PF8b: Supports signature sets.</dt>
        <dd>A signature set is an unordered set of signatures over
        a data payload. Use cases, such as cryptographic signatures
        applied to a legal contract, typically require more than
        one signature to be associated with the contract in order
        to legally bind two or more parties under the terms of the
        contract. Linked Data Proofs, including Linked Data
        Signatures, natively support sets of signatures. JWTs only

        <dd>All major search crawlers natively parse and index
        information expressed as JSON-LD in HTML pages. LD-Proofs
        enable the current data format that search engines use to
        be extended to support digital signatures. JWTs have no
        mechanism to express data in HTML pages and are currently

        <dd>When developers are debugging software systems, it is
        beneficial for them to be able to see the data that they
        are operating on using common debugging tools. Similarly,
        it is useful to be able to serialize data from the network
        to a database and then from the database back out to the
        network using a minimal number of pre and post processing
        steps. LD-Proofs enable developers to use common JSON
        tooling without having to convert the format into a
        different format or structure. JWTs base-64 encode payload
        information, resulting in complicated pre and post
        processing steps to convert the data into JSON data while
        not destroying the digital signature. Similarly,
        schema-less databases, which are typically used to index
        JSON data, cannot index information that is expressed in an
        opaque base-64 encoded wrapper.</dd>
        <dt id="pf11b">PF11b: Nesting signed data does not cause
        data size to double for every embedding.</dt>
        <dd>When a JWT is encapsulated by another JWT, the entire
        payload must be base-64 encoded in the initial JWT, and
        then base-64 encoded again in the encapsulating JWT. This
        is often necessary when a cryptographic signature is
        required on a document that contains a cryptographic
        signature, such as when a Notary signs a document that has
        been signed by someone else seeking the Notary's services.
        LD-Proofs do not require base-64 encoding the signed
        portion of a document and instead rely on a
        canonicalization process that is just as secure, and that
        only requires the cryptographic signature to be encoded
        instead of the entire payload.</dd>
        <dt id="pf12b">PF12b: Proof format supports Zero-Knowledge

        <dd>The LD-Proof format is capable of modifying the
        algorithm that generates the hash or hashes that are
        cryptographically signed. This cryptographic agility
        enables digital signature systems, such as Zero-Knowledge
        Proofs, to be layered on top of LD-Proofs instead of an
        entirely new digital signature container format to be
        created. JWTs are designed such that an entirely new
        digital signature container format will be required to
        support Zero-Knowledge Proofs.</dd>
        <dt id="pf13b">PF13b: Proof format supports arbitrary

        <dd>
          The LD-Proof format was designed with a broader range of
          proof types in mind and supports cryptographic proofs
          beyond simple cryptographic signatures. These proof types
          are in common usage in systems such as decentralized
          ledgers and provide additional guarantees to <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credentials</a>, such as
          the ability to prove that a particular claim was made at
          a particular time or that a certain amount of energy was
          expended to generate a particular credential. The JWT
          format does not support arbitrary proof formats.

        other data syntaxes such as XML, YAML, N-Quads, and
        CBOR.</dt>
        <dd>The LD-Proof format utilizes a canonicalization
        algorithm to generate a cryptographic hash that is used as
        an input to the cryptographic proof algorithm. This enables
        the bytes generated as the cryptographic proof to be
        compact and expressible in a variety of other syntaxes such
        as XML, YAML, N-Quads, and CBOR. Since JWTs require the use
        of JSON to be generated, they are inextricably tied to the
        JSON syntax.</dd>
        <dt id="pf15b">PF15b: Changing property-value ordering, or
        introducing whitespace does not invalidate signature.</dt>
        <dd>Since LD-Proofs utilize a canonicalization algorithm,
        the introduction of whitespace that does not change the
        meaning of the information being expressed has no effect on
        the final cryptographic hash over the information. This
        means that simple changes in whitespace formatting, such as
        those changes made when writing data to a schema-less
        database and then retrieving the same information from the
        same database do not cause the digital signature to fail.
        JWTs encode the payload using the base-64 format which is
        not resistant to whitespace formatting that has no effect
        on the information expressed. This shortcoming of JWTs make
        it challenging to, for example, express signed data in web
        pages that search crawlers index.</dd>
        <dt id="pf16b">PF16b: Designed to easily support
        experimental signature systems.</dt>
        <dd>The LD-Proof format is naturally extensible, not
        requiring the format to be extended in a formal
        international standards working group in order to prevent
        namespace collisions. The JWT format requires entries in a
        centralized registry in order to avoid naming collisions
        and does not support experimentation as easily as the
        LD-Proof format does. LD-Proof format extension is done
        through the decentralized publication of cryptographic
        suites that are guaranteed to not conflict with other
        LD-Proof extensions. This approach enables developers to
        easily experiment with new cryptographic signature
        mechanisms that support selective disclosure,
        zero-knowledge proofs, and post-quantum algorithms.</dd>
        <dt id="pf17b">PF17b: Supports signature chaining.</dt>
        <dd>A signature chain is an ordered set of signatures over
        a data payload. Use cases, such as cryptographic signatures

        signature by the signing party and then an additional one
        by a notary to be made after the original signing party has
        made their signature. Linked Data Proofs, including Linked
        Data Signatures, natively support chains of signatures.

<em>This section is

    <p>The Verifiable Credentials Data Model is designed to be
    compatible with a variety of existing and emerging digital
    proof formats. Each proof format has benefits and drawbacks.
    Many proof formats cannot selectively reveal attribute values
    from a verifiable credential; they can only reveal all (or
    none).</p>
    <p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are a proof format that enables
    data-minimization features in <a href="#dfn-verifiable-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable presentations</a>, such as
    selective disclosure and predicate proofs.</p>
    <h3 id="full-disclosure">Full Disclosure<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#zero-knowledge-proofs"></a>
</h3>
    <p>Currently, disclosing data is an all or nothing process,
    whether online or off. Many digital identity systems reveal all
    the attributes in a digital credential. The simplest method for
    signing a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a>
    signs the entire credential and when presented, fully discloses
    all the attributes.</p>
    <p>Along with a full disclosure of all the attributes in a
    <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a>, standard
    <a href="#dfn-verifiable-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable presentations</a> reveal the
    actual signature. With both the data and signature in hand, a
    <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a> has a complete copy of the credential.
    Without care, this could enable the <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a> to
    impersonate the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a>. Also, since the signature is
    the same every time this credential is presented, the signature
    itself is a unique identifier and becomes PII (personally
    identifiable information).</p>
    <p>It is also possible to fully disclose the attributes in a
    zero-knowledge <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a>.
    Unlike non-ZKP methods, zero-knowledge methods do not reveal
    the actual signature; instead, they only reveal a cryptographic
    proof of a valid signature. Only the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> of the
    signature has the information needed to present the <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> to a <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a>. This means
    that zero-knowledge methods provide a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> additional
    protection from impersonation. Because the signature is not
    revealed, it also cannot be used as a unique identifier.</p>
    <h3 id="selective-disclosure-0">Selective Disclosure<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#zero-knowledge-proofs"></a>
</h3>
    <p>Selective disclosure means that a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> doesn't
    have to reveal all of the attributes contained in a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a>. This reduces
    the liability of handling or holding data that it is not
    necessary to share or collect.</p>
    <p>Non-ZKP methods for selective disclosure often require the
    credential issuer to create a unique <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> for
    each individual attribute, or possible combination of
    attributes. This could quickly become impractical as the number
    of <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credentials</a> or combinations thereof
    exponentially explodes. Atomic <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credentials</a> (which only
    contain a single attribute) may also not guarantee that the
    data is properly paired when used in a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable presentation</a>. For example,
    a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> has two vehicle credentials, one for a 2018
    Mazda with 15,000 miles and the other for a 1965 Lincoln with
    350,000 miles. With atomic credentials it may be possible to
    claim the user has a 1965 Lincoln with 15,000 miles.</p>
    <p>Zero-knowledge methods allow a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> to choose which
    attributes to reveal and which attributes to withhold on a
    case-by-case basis without involving the <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a>. The
    <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a> only needs to provide a single
    <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a> that contains
    all of the attributes. Each attribute is individually
    incorporated into the signature. This enables two options: to
    reveal the attribute or to prove that you know the value of the
    attribute without revealing it. For example, a credential with
    attributes for name, birthdate, and address can be used in a
    presentation to reveal only your name.</p>
    <p>Non-ZKP methods implementing selective disclosure often
    requires the cooperation of the <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a>. Selective
    disclosure using zero-knowledge methods gives the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> personal control over what to reveal. A
    <a href="#dfn-verifiable-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable presentation</a> based on
    zero-knowledge proof mechanisms only contains those attributes
    and associated values that are required to satisfy the
    presentation requirements.</p>
    <h3 id="predicate-proofs">Predicate Proofs<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#zero-knowledge-proofs"></a>
</h3>
    <p>A predicate proof is a proof that answers a true-or-false
    question. For example, "Are you over the age of 18?" Using
    non-ZKP methods, predicate proofs must be provided by the
    <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a> as one of the attributes of a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a>. This means that
    in order for a non-ZKP <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> to be used to
    prove age-over-18, it would need to contain the attribute
    age-over-18. This <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> could not be used to reveal
    your birthdate, unless it also included a birthdate <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a>. It also couldn't be used to prove age-over-25.
    To prove age-over-25, the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> would need to
    have received a <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> with an age-over-25
    <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a>.</p>
    <p>Using zero-knowledge methods, predicate proofs can be
    generated by the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> at the time of <a href="#dfn-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">presentation</a> without <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a> involvement. For
    example, a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a>
    with the <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> birthdate can be used in a
    <a href="#dfn-verifiable-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable presentation</a> to prove
    age-over-18. The same <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> could then be
    used in another <a href="#dfn-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">presentation</a> to prove
    age-over-25, all without revealing the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder's</a>
    birthdate.</p>
    <h3 id="revocation">Revocation<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#zero-knowledge-proofs"></a>
</h3>
    <p><a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Verifiable credentials</a> may need to be
    revocable. If an <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a> can revoke a <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a>, <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiers</a> must be able
    to determine a <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential's</a> revocation status.</p>
    <p>Non-ZKP methods for checking revocation status may require
    the <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a> to directly contact the <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a>. Less restrictive checks could be made against
    a list of revoked credential identifiers posted in a public
    registry. The <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> is required to disclose the
    <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> identifier to the <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a> so that
    it can be checked. The <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a> is then
    responsible for doing the work to check revocation.</p>
    <p>Using zero-knowledge methods, the <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a>
    identifier can be checked against a list of revoked credential
    identifiers without revealing the identifier. This reduces the
    ability of network monitors to correlate a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder's</a> credential presentations, and removes the
    ability of an <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a> to be made aware of the
    presentation of <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credentials</a>
    they have issued.</p>
    <h3 id="correlation">Correlation<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#zero-knowledge-proofs"></a>
</h3>
    <p>Correlation is the ability to link data from multiple
    interactions to a single user. Correlation can be performed by
    a <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a>, by <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuers</a> and <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiers</a> working together, or by a third party
    observing interactions on the network. Correlation is a way to
    collect data about a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> without the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder's</a> consent or knowledge. It is also a way to
    deanonymize private transactions. For example, a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> might use a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a> to prove they
    are authorized to vote, then submit a secret ballot. If it is
    possible to correlate the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder's</a> <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> with the secret ballot, thereby linking a
    specific vote to a specific voter, it would be detrimental to
    the democratic process and could enable retaliation.</p>
    <p>One way to reduce correlation is through data minimization,
    by sharing only the information required to complete a
    transaction. Another way to reduce correlation is to make each
    interaction look unique. When interactions disclose unique
    identifiers, an observer can link multiple interactions to a
    single user. Non-ZKP methods with only a single identifier per
    user create correlation opportunities by embedding that
    identifier in multiple credentials or interactions.
    Zero-knowledge proofs remove this linkability between
    interactions.</p>
    <p>Non-ZKP methods that reveal all attributes and use unique
    identifiers are completely correlatable. Zero-knowledge methods
    enable data minimization and allow <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holders</a> to have
    trusted interactions with <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiers</a> without
    dependence on unique identifiers.</p>
    <p>Although correlation can never be eliminated completely, the
    goal of zero-knowledge methods is to reduce the probability of
    correlation and to put control over the level of correlation
    into the hands of the <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable
    credential</a> <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#zero-knowledge-proofs"></a>
</h3>
    <p>Zero-knowledge methods are more complex than non-ZKP
    methods. Cryptographic engineers must understand complicated
    protocols and write code to create libraries that support
    zero-knowledge methods. System implementers can then use these
    libraries without being exposed to the underlying complexity,
    but must trust that the implementation was done correctly. They
    can utilize the features of selective disclosure and bring the
    benefits of the method to their customers without a significant
    increase in effort over using non-ZKP methods.</p>
    <p>Due to the underlying complexity, zero-knowledge methods
    require more CPU and memory to use. This also adds to the time
    required to create and verify proofs. This should be considered
    when using less capable devices such as IOT devices or older
    phones.</p>
    <p>Another drawback of zero-knowledge proofs is that they tend
    to be larger than simple signatures.</p>
    <p>There is a perception that zero-knowledge methods are new
    and untested. Zero-knowledge methods were first introduced in
    1989 as a way to guard secrets. Although they may not be well
    understood by the general public, they have received
    considerable review and scrutiny in the cryptographic
    community. They are considered just as secure as many common
    cryptographic techniques in use today.</p>

    Progressive Trust<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#progressive-trust"></a>
</h2>
<em>This section is

    <p>Entities that use <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable
    credentials</a> and <a href="#dfn-verifiable-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable

    progressive trust. Progressive trust refers to enabling
    individuals to share information about themselves only on an as
    needed basis, slowing building up more trust as more
    information is shared with another party.</p>
    <p>Progressive trust is strongly related to the principle of
    data minimization, and enabled by technologies such as
    selective disclosure and predicate proofs. We encourage the use
    of progressive trust as a guiding principle for implementers as
    they develop protocols for <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuers</a>, <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holders</a>, and <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiers</a>.</p>

<bdi class="secno">12.1</bdi> Data Minimization<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#data-minimization"></a>
</h3>
      <p>Data minimization is a principle that encourages <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiers</a> to request the minimum amount of data
      necessary from <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holders</a>, and for <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holders</a> to only provide the minimum amount of data
      to <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiers</a>. This "minimum amount of
      data" depends on the situation and may change over the course
      of a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a>'s interaction with a <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a>.</p>
      <p>For example, a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> may apply for a loan, with a
      bank acting as the <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a>. There are
      several points at which the bank may want to determine
      whether the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> is qualified to continue in
      the process of applying for the loan; for instance, the bank
      may have a policy of only providing loans to existing account
      holders. A protocol that follows the principle of data
      minimization would allow the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> to reveal to
      the <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a> only that they are an
      existing account holder, before the bank requests any
      additional information, such as account balances or
      employment status. In this way, the applicant may
      progressively entrust the bank with more information, as the
      data needed by the bank to make its determinations is
      requested a piece at a time, as needed, rather than as a
      complete set, up front.</p>

<bdi class="secno">12.2</bdi> Selective Disclosure<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#selective-disclosure"></a>
</h3>
      <p>Selective disclosure is the ability of a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> to select some elements of a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a> to share with
      a <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a>, without revealing the rest. There are
      several different methods which support selective disclosure,
      we provide three examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Atomic Credentials</b> - These are <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credentials</a> which
          consist of a single claim. An <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a> may
          provide a set of atomic credentials that duplicates the
          claims of a standard credential. This atomicity allows a
          <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> to disclose only those
          claims which need to be revealed to a <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a>, rather than requiring all of the
          claims of a standard credential to be revealed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Selective Disclosure Signatures</b> - Certain
          signature schemes natively support selective disclosure
          of <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable
          credential</a> claims. One example of these is <a href="groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/lysyanskaya/cl02b.pdf">
          Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signatures</a>. Such Signatures
          allow a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> to disclose only those
          claims which need to be revealed to a <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a>, rather than requiring all of the
          credential's claims to be revealed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Hashed Values</b> - With this method, the <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a> issues a single <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a> containing
          all the <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuer</a>'s <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claims</a> about
          the subject. However, each <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> value is
          created by hashing the actual value with a different
          nonce so that the <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a> cannot
          determine the actual value. There are several different
          ways of modeling this, and no standard way is currently
          defined. The <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> includes the actual
          values of the <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claims</a> that are to be revealed
          to the <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a> in the <a href="#dfn-verifiable-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable presentation</a>.

<bdi class="secno">12.3</bdi>
      Predicates<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#predicates"></a>
</h3>
      <p>Another technique which may be used to support progressive
      trust is to use predicates as the values of revealed claims.
      Predicates allow a <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> to provide True/False values
      to a <a href="#dfn-verifier" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifier</a> rather than revealing claim
      values.</p>
      <p>Predicate proofs may be enabled by <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a> <a href="#dfn-issuers" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">issuers</a> as claims, e.g., the
      <code>credentialSubject</code> may include an
      <code>ageOver18</code> property rather than a
      <code>birthdate</code> property. This would allow <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holders</a> to provide proof that they are over 18
      without revealing their birthdates.</p>
      <p>Certain signature types enable predicate proofs by
      allowing claims from a standard <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a> to be
      presented as predicates. For example, a <a href="groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/lysyanskaya/cl02b.pdf">
      Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signed</a> <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a> that contains
      a <code>credentialSubject</code> with a
      <code>birthdate</code> property may be included in a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable presentation</a> as a derived
      credential that contains an <code>ageOver18</code>
      property.</p>

      <p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
      <a href="www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/">Web
      Authentication</a> specification extends the capabilities of
      in-browser web applications by enabling them to strongly
      authenticate users with the aid of scoped public key-based
      credentials. It defines the idea of <a href="www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#authenticator">authenticators</a>,
      which are cryptographic entities that can generate and store
      public key credentials at the behest of a Relying Party,
      subject to user consent, mediated by the web browser to
      preserve user privacy.</p>
      <p>Since the key based credentials created by <a href="www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/">Web Authentication Level
      1</a> authenticators are narrowly scoped to a particular
      Relying Party origin, they are unsuited (in their current
      form) to general purpose signature and verification
      operations. However, many web developers working with
      <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Verifiable Credentials</a> have
      expressed interest in leveraging the Web Authentication API,
      since it provides a secure browser-mediated interface to
      crucial key management infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The Web Authentication Working Group has agreed to address
      this use case in the WebAuthn Level 2 specification, and is
      currently working to enable the kind of <a href="github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/911">cross-origin
      usage</a> that would allow the WebAuthn API to be used for
      <a href="#dfn-verifiable-presentations" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable presentations</a>. For
      example, verifiable credential wallets could allow
      authentication based on verifiable presentations, by using

      challenges from verifier websites.</p>
