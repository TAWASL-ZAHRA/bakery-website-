<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This note summarizes the relationship between RDF-Schema and
UML, the generic industry standard object-oriented modeling framework
for information systems modeling. This note will briefly describe
these systems then relate them to each other.</p>

<h2>RDF-Schema</h2>

<p>RDF-Schema specifies information about classes in a schema,
including properties (attributes) and relationships between classes.
RDF-Schema provides a typing system: informally, it is a basic
set of nodes and relations that can be used to express properties
of classes of the schema. RDF-Schema includes a facility to indicate
that certain classes are subclasses of others, and provides a
small number of basic classes. Finally, it contains a facility
for specifying a small number of constraints such as the cardinality
(number of occurrences) required and permitted of properties of
instances of classes.</p>

<p>&quot;RDF-Schemas are specified using a declarative representation
language influenced by ideas from knowledge representation, e.g.,
semantic nets, frames, and predicate logic, as well as database
schema representation models such as binary relational models
([NIAM], etc.) and graph data models. The RDF schema specification
language is less expressive, but simpler, than full predicate
calculus languages such as CycL [CycL] and KIF [KIF].&quot;</p>

<h2>UML</h2>

<p>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a framework for describing
a set of models that capture the functional and structural semantics
of any complex information system. UML defines the following models
for representing such systems:</p>

<p>1. A use case model that states the requirements of the user<br>
2. A class model that captures the static information structure
of objects<br>
3. A state model that describes the dynamic behavior of objects
<br>
4. An activity implementation model that describes work unit actions<br>
5. An interaction model that models scenarios and message flows<br>
6. A deployment model that describes how software subsystems are
allocated<br>
to actual hardware components</p>

<h2>How RDF and UML Relate to Each Other</h2>

<p>Web-based and non-Web based applications can be described by
a number of schema specification mechanisms, including RDF-Schema.
The RDF-Schema model itself is equivalent to a subset of the class
model in UML. RDF-Schema uses a DLG (Directed Labeled Graph) model
for describing schemas.</p>

<p>Class schemas expressed in UML can be viewed also as DLGs.
If a DLG is used for a class model schema in UML, the RDF-Schema
DLG can be shown to be isomorphic to a subgraph of the UML class
schema DLG. This is possible because RDF-Schema elements map directly
into UML class model elements.</p>

<p>In addition, the DAG formed by considering RDF-Schema subClassOf
class inheritance structures maps directly to UML class generalization
DAGs, RDF class properties map to UML class attributes, and RDF
properties and property cardinality constraints map to UML associations
and association <br>
constraints.</p>

<p>The various constructs and elements in the class models of
UML (#2.) and RDF-Schema readily map between each other. While
currently the RDF-Schema work does not have counterparts to the
other 5 remaining UML modeling areas, RDF-Schema could be extended
to support these models as well.</p>

<p>Given that an application schema can be described by RDF-Schema
(or UML), how do RDF-Schema and UML actually relate to each other?
The remainder of this note describes the relationship between
the elements of the class models for RDF-Schema and UML. An outline
is presented below to show how a given schema represented by the
RDF-Schema model can be transformed into an equivalent UML class
schema representation.</p>

<p>Further, given any UML class schema representation, we can
specify an equivalent RDF-Schema representation.</p>

<h2>Comparison of Models</h2>

<p>Outlined below are the steps for showing that class schema
representations using RDF-Schema and the class model subset of
UML are equivalent.</p>

    <td>

  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td height="84">
    &nbsp;5.</td> 
    <td>
    Having accomplished 1,2, and the portion of 3 relevant to the
    RDF-Schema, we can then show that the full RDF-Schema DLG can
    map into a proper subgraph of the UML class model DLG.&nbsp;</td>
  </tr> 
</table></center>

<p><br>
As noted, because UML contains additional modeling constructs
not found in RDF-Schema, full specification using UML may result
in a DLG model that is a superset of the model specified by RDF-Schema.
However, as indicated earlier, extensions to the RDF-Schema model
could be made to support these class model constructs as well
as other UML system models as needed by future application schemas
that use RDF-Schema.</p>

<h2>How RDF-Schema Properties and UML Roles Relate</h2>

<p>We note that RDF-Schema properties can correspond to UML roles,
and when a PropertyType actually names a range that is another
RDF-Schema class, one way this can be viewed is that the RDF-Schema
property is in fact being used as an association in the UML sense.
More precisely, an RDF-Schema property corresponds to a named
role within an unnamed association. UML has some facilities here
(such as naming associations and associating roles) that RDF-Schema
does not. [Layman,1]</p>

<p>[Wickstead] has presented several good examples of this in
the context of RDF-Schema WG discussions about non-Web resource
identifiers: he suggests that instead of introducing database
Primary/Foreign Keys, we let properties name actual classes. This
would cause the property to be used as an association to other
objects constrained by whatever cardinality constraint was specified.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>A class of application schemas can be described by RDF-Schema.
RDF-Schema in turn can be shown to map into a subset of the UML
framework through inheritance schema DAG isomorphism and isomorphism
of RDF-Schema DLGs to a subgraph of UML full schema DLGs using
the procedure outlined above.</p>

<h3>Table Notes:</h3>

<p>(1) Public - the element is visible to all clients of the class.<br>
(2) Protected - the element is visible only to the subclass of
the class.<br>
(3) Private - the element is visible to only the class itself.<br>
(4) UML distinguishes between aggregation and composition: aggregation
is an abstract modeling, composition is a containment model
that can correspond to the RDF-Schema collection, bag, or
sequence constructs.<br>
(5) RDF-Schema can use directed arcs, UML uses directed associations.<br>
(6) RDF-Schema cardinality constraints are a subset of UML multiplicity
constraints. UML allows specification of multiplicity information
at
both ends of an association. RDF-Schema currently does not directly
support cardinality constraints besides the 4 listed. Supporting
arbitrary cardinalities e.g., 2-100 times would be useful, as
well as
intervals e.g., 3..5,17..23 would be useful. In the table, M and N
are integers &gt; 1.<br>
(7) While both RDF-Schema and UML have MetaModels, it is worth
pointing
out that the UML meta model is both substantially more elaborate
and
different than that of RDF-Schema meta model. [Layman,2]<br>
(8) We note that the intended usages for RDF-Schema and UML may
differ.
While both systems can describe schemas, each system may be better
suited for a particular application. Eg., databases are described
by
schemas defining tables, views, referential integrity constraints,
and other database mechanisms; models of tree-structure grammars
such
as XML are described by schemas such as XML DTDs; models of entities
and relations are described in E-R schemas such as UML; models
of
nodes and arcs are described by node-and-arc schemas such as RDF
schemas. While there is substantial overlap between RDF and UML,
we anticipate that each will be used to describe somewhat different
entities. [Layman,2]</p>
