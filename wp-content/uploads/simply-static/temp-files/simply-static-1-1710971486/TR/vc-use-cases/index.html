    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement,
    quality, or piece of information about an <a href="#dfn-entities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entity's</a> background such as a name, government ID,
    payment provider, home address, or university degree. Such a
    claim describes a quality or qualities, property or properties
    of an <a href="#dfn-entities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entity</a> which establish its existence
    and uniqueness. The use cases outlined here are provided in
    order to make progress toward possible future standardization
    and interoperability of both low- and high-stakes <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claims</a> with the goals of storing, transmitting, and
    receiving digitally verifiable proof of attributes such as
    qualifications and achievements. The use cases in this document
    focus on concrete scenarios that the technology defined by the
    group should address.</p>

</h2>
    <p>The Verifiable Claims Working Group at the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> is developing standards
    for expressing and exchanging "<a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claims</a>" that have been
    verified by a third party and to make them easier and more
    secure on the Web.</p>

        This document does NOT attempt to define an architecture
        for the support of Verifiable Claims. Instead it expresses
        the sorts of needs that real users have that could be
        addressed through support for some sort of self-sovereign
        claim environment. It attempts to use terminology that is
        consistent with the other deliverables of the Verifiable
        Claims Working Group (you can see the relevant terms in
        Appendix A).

      <p>Entities (people, organizations, devices) need to make
      many kinds of <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claims</a> as part of their everyday
      activities. As more and more of these important activities
      move to the Internet, <a href="#dfn-entities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entities</a> need to be
      able to transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims (e.g.,
      about their location, accomplishments, value, what-have-you).
      From educational records to payment account access, the next
      generation of web applications will authorize <a href="#dfn-entities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entities</a> to perform actions based on rich sets of
      credentials issued by trusted parties. Human- and
      machine-mediated decisions about job applications, account
      access, collaboration, and professional development will
      depend on filtering and analyzing growing amounts of data. It
      is essential that data be verifiable.</p>
      <p>Standardization of digital <a href="#dfn-claims" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">claim</a> technologies
      makes it possible for many stakeholders to issue, earn, and
      trust these essential records about their counterparties,
      without being locked into proprietary platforms.</p>

</h3>
      <p>This document presents an aggregate use case model,
      comprised of Needs, Roles, Tasks, and Sequences. Taken
      together, these models define the use cases that the
      Verifiable Claims Working Group has addressed.</p>
      <p>User needs define the problem space addressed by <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credentials</a>. User Roles
      specify the roles different <a href="#dfn-entities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entities</a> play when
      interacting with <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable
      credentials</a>. Tasks define the functions users can
      accomplish, and sequences demonstrate how tasks might be
      realized, by interactions between <a href="#dfn-entities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">entities</a> over
      time.</p>
      <p>As with all models, this use case model is neither
      exhaustive nor complete. The listed uses cannot capture all
      possible use cases. Similarly, the models do not completely
      characterize the use cases represented. However, the combined
      model is intended to provide specific, coherent guidance for
      the work ahead.</p>

          Jane is opening an account at MidBank in Finland. As part
          of that process, the bank asks her to provide two from a
          variety of possible sources to confirm her identity — a
          so-called "Know Your Customer" check. She selects
          government-supplied <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable
          credentials</a> that confirm she receives postal mail at
          a certain address and that she has a national ID card.
          Confirming these allows the bank to open her account and
          be confident in her identity when she conducts
          transactions.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          Now that the account is open, Jane is issued a
          digitally-signed <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> for her
          checking account at MidBank. This <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> verifies that Jane has an account at
          MidBank and has access to her associated checking
          account. Since MidBank (and all banks in Finland) are
          required to perform "Know Your Customer" checks on
          accounts, this credential can also be used as sufficient
          verification by other financial institutions. This can
          help Jane assure destination banks that she is verified,

          and money laundering.

          "Freedom?" is an online forum that encourages free
          discussion about issues controversial in Freedonia. The
          forum allows users to register anonymous accounts, but it
          also allows users to obtain badges based upon real-world
          certifications. Paula has been certified as an aid
          worker, and wishes that information to be marked on her
          posts. She shares her certificate with the forum, but
          limits it to only verifying that she is the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> of the certificate, that she is the
          <a href="#dfn-subjects" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">subject</a> of it, and that she is
          an aid worker. In this way she maintains her anonymity in
          this controversial forum while still being able to assist
          her fellow countrymen.

        turmoil, there is no way for the IFRC staff to easily
        establish their identities. Fortunately, Anoushka had been
        issued a self-sovereign proof of birth, attached to which
        is the proof of birth and marriage for her parents. She is
        able to retrieve this because it is available from many

          identifying <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> can be verified by
          Sam, IT technician, to establish the identity of the
          controller as part of the on-boarding of the new
          controller. The controller's specification-compliance
          <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> is verified to

          issued by Vince, a systems engineer at VAR Resellers, as

          <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credentials</a>
          accompanying the device. He then installs a software

          <p>Sam, the new device owner, needs to trust the device
          originated from HVAC Manufacturing and was handled
          correctly at Certifications Testing Lab and installed
          with the correct software package at VAR Resellers. After
          Sam verifies each of the <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credentials</a>, he
          issues another <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable
          credential</a> for fan controller #37 which includes
          assertions relating to trust: device manufacturer
          model/version, software manufacturer model/version,
          security versions of components TCB, and associated
          devices the fan controller is authorized to interact with
          including thermostat-board-room.</p>
          <p>The thermostat-board-room monitors room temperature.
          When the temperature is too hot it switches the fan
          controller #37 on and later when the temperature reaches
          a comfortable level, off. The device makes sure the
          control signals from thermostat-board-room are authorized
          (namely, that Sam intended for thermostat-board-room to
          control the fan controller).</p>
          <p>Sam is concerned about the security of the smart board
          room. He configures the autonomously interacting devices
          to re-verify device trustworthiness attributes
          periodically by re-checking that the device originated
          from HVAC Manufacturing and was handled correctly by
          Certifications Testing Lab and installed with the correct
          software package by VAR Resellers.</p>
          <p>Sam may update the device’s software occasionally
          during its lifetime. Even though Sam is applying the
          update, VAR Resellers supplies the correct update. The
          device ensures that only VAR Resellers is able to supply
          the updated software image and that only Sam is able to
          apply the update.</p>

      <p>Pat earned multiple diving credentials while living and
      working in Fiji and Australia. Later, Pat is hired by NOAA as
      a Dive Instructor, which requires that they maintain
      certification as an instructor with additional specialist
      diver certifications in dry suit, night diving, and search
      and recovery. The dive instructor certification is public
      record, but the additional specialist certifications are
      private because they are for personal diving, not acting as
      an instructor.</p>
      <p>Part of Pat's job is logging the certifications of fellow
      divers during NOAA sanctioned dives.</p>
      <h4 id="distinction-0">Distinction<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#expert-dive-instructor"></a>

      <p>This use case is difficult because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Certification in Fiji and Australia. NOAA relies on an
        international certification agency, PADI, with relevance in
        multiple jurisdictions.</li>
        <li>Each of these <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credentials</a> is
        issued by different schools in the name of PADI.
        </li>
        <li>Each <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> has an independent
        expiration cycle.
        </li>
        <li>Pat grants NOAA permission (the capability) to validate
        future <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credential</a> status changes.
        </li>
        <li>On each trip, Pat creates a certified log of all
        divers, effectively issuing a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verified credential</a> about other
        <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credentials</a>.

      </ul>
      <h4 id="scenario-0">Scenario<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#expert-dive-instructor"></a>
</h4>
      <p>When Pat applied for his job at NOAA, he provided <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credentials</a> issued by
      different dive schools licensed by PADI to do so. NOAA
      verifies cryptographically that the certifications were
      issued by PADI-approved dive schools and that the credentials
      were still in good standing by checking both the
      certifications' *and* the dive schools' revocation
      services.</p>
      <p>Upon accepting the job, Pat issues NOAA a revocable token
      that allows NOAA to check the current status of all of his
      certifications — not just the status of a single <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a>. After any
      specific certification expires — and Pat renews it — NOAA's
      next check of Pat's certifications returns the status of the
      renewed certification, not just the status of the (now
      expired) <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable
      credential</a>.</p>
      <p>When Pat takes a group of divers on NOAA sanctioned dives,
      he records the <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credentials</a>
      for each diver (which demonstrate their diving
      certifications), creates a <a href="#dfn-verifiable-credentials" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">verifiable credential</a> including
      those <a href="#dfn-credential" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">credentials</a>; he signs and archives
      it on his laptop.</p>
      <p>When Pat retires from NOAA, he revokes that token and NOAA
      staff is no longer able to monitor his non-public
      certification status.</p>

      <p>This use case is difficult because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Current US passports do not establish explicit

        <li>When one parent travels with a minor, the other parent
        is required to grant permission for the trip, thus implying
        guardianship or responsibility.</li>
        <li>The DID or other Digital Identity system replaces the
        role of the notary in the paper/physical world</li>
        <li>Credentials must be coordinated between two verifiers
        (agent and airline) for two individuals, and a digital
        coupon is used.</li>
        <li>The relationship of the minor to the non-traveling
        parent must be established, in order for the permission to
        be considered.</li>
        <li>In the minor's passport case, the <a href="#dfn-subjects" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">subject</a> is not the <a href="#dfn-holders" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">holder</a> of
