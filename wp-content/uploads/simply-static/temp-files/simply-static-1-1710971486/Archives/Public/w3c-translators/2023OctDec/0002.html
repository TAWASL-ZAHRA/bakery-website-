Objet : Intent of translation of WCAG 2.2 into French
Dear all,
following the Policy for W3C Authorized Translations, Step 1, at <a href="www.w3.org/2005/02/TranslationPolicy">https://www.w3.org/2005/02/TranslationPolicy</a>, as Lead Translator Organization, LTO of WCAG 2.1, we would like to inform you that Access42 intends to become LTO for the WCAG 2.2 Authorized W3C Translation into French as soon as WCAG 2.2 is finalized as a W3C recommendation.
Among the group of 41 stakeholders who participated in the translation of WCAG 2.1, more than 20 organizations belonging to French speaking countries (Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Quebec/Canada…), involved in public sector administrations, companies working in the field of web accessibility, private companies, university, have already expressed their interest in continuing helping to review future translation works.
We will submit the list of interested organizations once WCAG 2.2 is finalized.
